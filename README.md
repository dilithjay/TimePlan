# TimePlan
This is an application that can be used to plan one's time effectively in order to get the best use out of it. The software is currently targeted primarily towards Undergraduates but it can be useful for anyone.

Then plan can be divided into 3 categories:
* Long Term Plan
* Semester Plan
* Weekly Plan

Additionally there is another tab known as Week Board (Explained below)
Of course, what each section is used for is entirely upto the user but the following is how I intended and how I use it.

### Long Term Plan
This plan may include more long term goals that are wished to be completed before graduating or otherwise. Goals such as completing this many personal projects, writing this many research papers, obtaining a first class, etc. can be included under this plan. This is intended as more of a motivator as opposed to the other plans which were intended as deadline.
### Semester Plan
This consists of tasks that the user wishes to complete before the end of the semester. This may include tasks such as finding a topic for a research paper, writing a research paper, complete a personal project, contribute to a certain open source project, etc.
### Weekly Plan
This plan can be used to schedule the tasks planned to be done within the week. Tasks can be added either for a specific day of the week or to be completed on any day within the week. Check the [**How to Use**](#how-to-use) section for more information.
### Week Board
All the daily tasks scheduled for the week would be displayed here. The tasks can be ticked off from this board as well.

## How to Use
- **Select Plan:** Choose the required plan from the panels on the left.
- **Add normal task:** For each plan, type the task in the text box and click `Add`.
- **Add task to week board:** Select the day of the week using radio buttons above the text box, type the task on the text box and press `Add`.
- **Remove task:** Select a task from the list and click `Remove`. Removing from the Weekly Plan will also remove the task from the Week Board.
