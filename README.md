# TimePlan
This is an application that can be used to plan one's time effectively in order to get the best use out of it. The software is currently targeted primarily towards Undergraduates but it can be useful for anyone.

Currently, the plan is divided into 5 categories:
* Long Term Plan
* Semester Plan
* Weekly Plan
* Daily Plan
* Week Board (new addition)

Of course, what each section is used for is entirely upto the user but the following is how I intended and how I use it.

### Week Board
All the daily tasks scheduled for the week would be displayed here. The tasks can be ticked off from this board as well. The addition of this section may invalidate the purpose of the daily plan in some way. However, the daily plan shall not be removed for now.
### Daily Plan
This is where all the every day tasks should be posted. This may include urgent activities like assignments, preparation for quizes or even leisure activities like watching movies, TV shows, etc.
### Weekly Plan
The current implementation is set up such that the daily plan and the weekly plan keeps track of 2 entirely seperate lists. While the weekly plan is usable as it is to include less urgent tasks like preparation for exams, etc. The user can add tasks to the week board by specifying which day of the week the task belongs to. Check the [**How to Use**](#how-to-use) section for more information.
### Semester Plan
This consists of tasks that the user wishes to complete before the end of the semester. This may include tasks such as finding a topic for a research paper, writing a research paper, complete a personal project, contribute to a certain open source project, etc.
### Long Term Plan
This plan may include more long term goals that are wished to be completed before graduating or otherwise. Goals such as completing this many personal projects, writing this many research papers, obtaining a first class, etc. can be included under this plan. This is intended as more of a motivator as opposed to the other plans which were intended as deadline.

## How to Use
