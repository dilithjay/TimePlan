# TimePlan
This is an application that can be used to plan one's time effectively in order to get the best use out of it. The software is currently targeted primarily towards Undergraduates but it can be useful for anyone.

Currently, the plan is divided into 4 categories:
* Long Term Plan
* Semester Plan
* Weekly Plan
* Daily Plan

Of course, what each section is used for is entirely upto the user but the following is how I intended and how I use it.

### Daily Plan
This is where all the every day tasks should be posted. This may include urgent activities like assignments, preparation for quizes or even leisure activities like watching movies, TV shows, etc.
### Weekly Plan
The current implementation is set up such that the daily plan and the weekly plan keeps track of 2 entirely seperate lists. While the weekly plan is usable as it is to include less urgent tasks like preparation for exams, etc., I wish to keep track of one list for both weekly and daily plans and provide the user with the option to assign each task to a day of the week. This way, the user can see all the tasks for the week on the Weekly plan and see all the daily tasks on the daily plan.
### Semester Plan
This consists of tasks that the user wishes to complete before the end of the semester. This may include tasks such as finding a topic for a research paper, writing a research paper, complete a personal project, contribute to a certain open source project, etc.
### Long Term Plan
This plan may include more long term goals that are wished to be completed before graduating or otherwise. Goals such as completing this many personal projects, writing this many research papers, obtaining a first class, etc. can be included under this plan. This is intended as more of a motivator as opposed to the other plans which were intended as deadline.
